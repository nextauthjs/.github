# Contributing guide

Contributions and feedback on your experience of using this software are welcome. This includes bug reports, feature requests, ideas, pull requests, and examples of how you have used this software.

Please see the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow any templates configured in GitHub when reporting bugs, requesting enhancements, or contributing code.

If you found a security vulnerability, please do not open an issue nor raise a Pull Request for it. Kindly follow our [Security Disclosure Guide](https://authjs.dev/security#reporting-a-vulnerability).

Please raise any significant new functionality or breaking change an issue for discussion before raising a Pull Request for it.

## For contributors

Anyone can be a contributor. Either you found a typo, or you have an awesome feature request you could implement, we encourage you to create a Pull Request.

Before contributing, we recommend you read the [Tour de Source: NextAuth.js](https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks/Tm90ZWJvb2s6MTc2MQ==) post to become more familiar with the libraries inner workings.

### Pull Requests

- We are maintaining two major branches:
  - The `main` is for the latest changes regarding the `core` package, the adapters packages, and framework packages.
  - The `v4` branch is for `next-auth@v4` related changes.
  - Please make your Pull Request against the according branch.
- Pull Requests need approval of a [core contributor](https://next-auth.js.org/contributors#core-team) before merging.
- We use TypeScript for source.
- We use ESLint/Prettier for linting/formatting, so please run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` before committing to make resolving conflicts easier (VSCode users, check out [this ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [this Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to fix lint and formatting issues in development).
- We encourage you to test your changes, and if you have the opportunity, please make those tests part of the Pull Request.
- If you add new functionality, please provide the corresponding documentation as well and make it part of the Pull Request. We use JSDoc, which means most of the time, the documentation is in the same file as the source code.

#### Adding a new Provider

> NOTE: We only support new providers in the `@auth/core` package going forward.

If you think your custom provider might be useful to others, we encourage you to open a PR and add it to the built-in list so others can discover it much more easily! You will have to make the following changes:

1. Add your config: [`packages/core/src/providers/{provider}.ts`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/packages/core/src/providers) (Make sure you use a named default export, like `export default function YourProvider`).
1. Add the provider documentation in the same file using JSDoc.
1. Add the provider logo to the `docs/static/img/providers/` directory.
1. Add the provider in the drop-down list in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2_bug_provider.yml`](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2_bug_provider.yml)

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Others will be able to discover this provider much more easily now!

You can look at the existing built-in providers for inspiration.
- If you are adding a new OIDC provider, take a look at [auth0.ts](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/auth0.ts).
- If you are adding a new OAuth 2.0 provider, take a look at [google.ts](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/packages/core/src/providers/google.ts).

#### Adding a new Database Adapter

If you would like to contribute to an existing database adapter or help create a new one, please follow this [guide](https://authjs.dev/guides/adapters/creating-a-database-adapter#official-adapter-guidelines).

> NOTE: For core team reviewer, make sure to check all database queries to avoid introduce any vulnerabilities.

### Setting up local environment

We use Turborepo and pnpm for managing our packages.

#### Repo structure
```
next-auth/
â”œâ”€ apps/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ dev/ <-- contains our dev app for nextjs, sveltekit, etc.
â”‚  â”œâ”€ examples/ <-- contains our examples. These will be synced to the example template repos.
â”‚  â”œâ”€ playgrounds/ <-- experimental stuff
â”œâ”€ packages/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ adapter-*/ <-- adapter packges.
â”‚  â”œâ”€ core/ <-- the core package. Most of the logic is here.
â”‚  â”œâ”€ framework-*/ <-- framework packages
â”‚  â”œâ”€ next-auth/ <-- next-auth@v5
â”œâ”€ docs/
```

Here is a quick guide on how to setup _next-auth_ locally to work on it and test out any changes:

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:nextauthjs/next-auth.git
cd next-auth
```

2. Set up the correct pnpm version, using [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). Run the following in the project'a root:

```sh
corepack enable pnpm
```

(Now, if you run `pnpm --version`, it should print the same verion as the `packageManager` property in the [`package.json` file](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/blob/main/package.json))

3. Install packages. Developing requires Node.js v18:

```sh
pnpm install
```

4. Populate `.env.local`:

Copy `apps/dev/nextjs/.env.local.example` to `apps/dev/nextjs/.env.local`, and add your env variables for each provider you want to test.

```sh
cd apps/dev/nextjs
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

> NOTE: You can add any environment variables to .env.local that you would like to use in your dev app.
> You can find the next-auth config under `apps/dev/nextjs/auth.config.ts`.

5. Start the developer application/server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Your developer application will be available on `http://localhost:3000`

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

If you need an example project to link to, you can use [next-auth-example](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example).

#### Hot reloading

When running `pnpm dev`, you start a Next.js developer server on `http://localhost:3000`, which includes hot reloading out-of-the-box. Make changes on any of the files in `src` and see the changes immediately.

> NOTE: When working on CSS, you will have to manually refresh the page after changes. The reason for this is our pages using CSS are server-side rendered (using API routes). (Improving this through a PR is very welcome!)

> NOTE: The setup is as follows: The development application lives inside the `app` folder, and whenever you make a change to the `src` folder in the root (where next-auth is), it gets copied into `app` every time (gitignored), so Next.js can pick them up and apply hot reloading. This is to avoid some annoying issues with how symlinks are working with different React builds, and also to provide a super-fast feedback loop while developing core features.

#### Testing

Tests can be run with `pnpm test`.

Automated tests are currently crude and limited in functionality, but improvements are in development.

## For maintainers

We use [a custom script](https://github.com/balazsorban44/monorepo-release) together with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) to automate releases. This makes the maintenance process easier and less error-prone. Please study the "Conventional Commits" site to understand how to write a good commit message.

When accepting Pull Requests, make sure the following:

- Use "Squash and merge"
- Make sure you merge contributor PRs into `main`
- Rewrite the commit message to conform to the `Conventional Commits` style.
  - Using `fix` releases a patch (x.x.1)
  - Using `feat` releases a minor (x.1.x)
  - Using `feat` when `BREAKING CHANGE` is present in the commit message releases a major (1.x.x)
- Optionally link issues the PR will resolve (You can add "close" in front of the issue numbers to close the issues automatically, when the PR is merged. `semantic-release` will also comment back to connected issues and PRs, notifying the users that a feature is added/bug fixed, etc.)

### Skipping a release

If a commit contains `[skip release]` in their message, it will be excluded from the commit analysis and won't participate in the release type determination. This is useful, if the PR being merged should not trigger a new `npm` release.
